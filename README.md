The FreeBASIC Extended Library is always looking for new submissions.
Submissions do not necessarily need to be code, in fact our primary concern
at the moment is improving the documentation. We feel the best way to improve
the documentation is with more tutorials and a User's Guide that combines an
overview of the api (the what) of the modules with the why, the how and the
when. So if you are handy with a text editor and know your way around a certain
part of the library, please help us out by writing a tutorial or an in-depth
article about a submodule/class/set of functions. After review, your submission
may be added to the User's Guide. Thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy
using the FreeBASIC Extended Library as much as we have enjoyed working on it!

The FreeBASIC Extended Library aims to provide a portable, community-driven set of
libraries designed exclusively for FreeBASIC development, and includes many commonly
used game-oriented and general purpose APIs written by the community and licensed
under a BSD type license to maximize user freedom.

Designed to be an effective "all-in-one" set of libraries, The FreeBASIC Extended
Library can improve quality and production of your FreeBASIC projects by providing
common functionality that is tuned to be fast. The FreeBASIC Extended Library is
very modular with few inter-dependencies so you do not need to distribute a large
DLL for the extra functionality.

Many libraries within The FreeBASIC Extended Library make use of _ext/Templates_,
a header-only library containing macros that enable generic programming similar to
that of C++, allowing you to write more reusable code faster.
